Cocoda is a web application to manage and create mappings between knowledge organization systems, such as classifications, authority files, and thesauri. See [cocoda documentation](https://gbv.github.io/cocoda/) for details and [git repository](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda) for source code.

### Use Cocoda mapping tool

The [cocoda manual](https://gbv.github.io/cocoda/#manual) gives a short introduction.

We also prepared some screencasts (in German):

* [Mapping mit Cocoda 0.6.0](https://vimeo.com/307653028) (5 minutes, 2018-12-21)
* [Kurzeinf√ºhrung Mapping mit Cocoda 0.5.1](https://vimeo.com/296616305) (3 minutes, 2018-10-23)

#### History

The first prototype of Cocoda was started in February 2014: the source 
is [archived at GitHub](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda-prototype) and 
[this screencast](https://vimeo.com/309446476) gives an impression.
