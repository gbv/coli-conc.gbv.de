  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    The availability of tools and standards has increased the use and
    exchange of knowledge organisation systems (KOS) during the last few years.
    Concordances between these systems, are, however,  rather rare.  Project coli-conc
    aims to address this gap by developing tools, methods and techniques to
    simplify and accelerate both the intellectual creation of concordances as well
    as ease the use and exchange of the same and at the same time provide quality
    monitoring  that aid  quality management (provide quality assessment).
  </p>
  <p>
    The project will create a set of reusable software modules to enable a uniform
    access to knowledge organization systems, concordances and concordance
    assessments. These modules will be provided as web application to support
    effective processing of concordances. In addition, existing
    software (KOS software, mapping algorithms, cataloguing software â€¦) will be
    evaluated and enhanced  with new components for storage, access to  and
    analysis of different concordances. These components will be linked
    with each other through uniform and open APIs , so that a shared infrastructure
    is developed for the management, exchange and building of concordances.
