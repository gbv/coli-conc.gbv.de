{% section %}

An **occurrence** gives the number of times a selected concept is used in a given database.  Co-occurrences give the number for combination of concepts so they
can be used as mapping recommendations.  An API to query (co-)occurrences from PICA databases is available at <https://coli-conc.gbv.de/occurrences/api/>.
