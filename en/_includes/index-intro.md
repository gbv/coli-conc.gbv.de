coli-conc enables interoperability between Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) with focus on German library KOS. It provides a technical infrastructure to manage KOS and KOS mappings in order to facilitate a seamless access and use. This service provided by the VZG offers open source web-based applications that include:

- [KOS Registry]({{ "/terminologies/" | url }}) for an uniform access to KOS and their metadata in [JSKOS format](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/),
- [Concordance Registry]({{ "/concordances/" | url }}) to collect, store and manage single concept mappings and complete concordances,
- [Mapping Tool Cocoda]({{ "/cocoda/" | url }}) to support computer-assisted mappings and assess the quality of mappings, and
- [Software]({{ "/publications/software/" | url }}) for the conversion of KOS and mappings from their proprietary format to JSKOS as well as to import and export both KOS and mapping data.

The current focus is on library classifications Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), Regensburg Classification (RVK), and Basisklassifikation (BK) to build complete concordances for German libraries. The infrastructure can also be used for other systems such as Wikidata and GND.
