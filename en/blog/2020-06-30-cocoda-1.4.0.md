Release 1.4.0 of [Cocoda]({{ "/cocoda/" | url}}) contains several bugfixes and internal refactoring. Most important we moved core methods to access JSKOS via APIs to an independent module [cocoda-sdk](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda-sdk) and we started to provide Docker images for hosting Cocoda.

You can find the full release notes [on GitHub](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/releases/tag/1.4.0).
