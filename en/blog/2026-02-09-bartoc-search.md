With BARTOC Search, a redesigned interface introduces a new search experience. Faceted filters help you refine results by KOS type, language, format group, licence group, or country - while improved ranking brings the most relevant results to the top in a clearly structured list.

Try out [BARTOC Search](https://bartoc.org/vocabularies/?sort=relevance&order=desc&limit=10) and explore the new search features.
