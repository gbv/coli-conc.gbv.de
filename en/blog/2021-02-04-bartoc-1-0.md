At the end of 2020 the [terminology registry BARTOC](https://bartoc.org/) was migrated to the head office of common library network (VZG). Team coli-conc is responsible for its maintenance since then. In the last month we fixed the pending bugs and polished the user interface to finally reach a stable [release version 1.0.0](https://github.com/gbv/bartoc.org/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Major improvements include an enhanced [search](http://bartoc.org/vocabularies) with multiple sort options and improved vocabulary editing.

BARTOC is continuously extended, your [feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated](https://github.com/gbv/bartoc.org/issues)! To add or modify vocabulary metadata please [contact the editors](http://bartoc.org/contact).
