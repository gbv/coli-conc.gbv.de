The [terminology registry BARTOC](https://bartoc.org/) has been moved to the head office of common library network [Gemeinsamer Bibliotheksverbund (GBV)](https://www.gbv.de/Verbundzentrale-en/about-vzg/information-about-gbv-and-the-head-office-vzg). BARTOC contains information about more than 5.000 knowledge organization systems such as thesauri, ontologies, and authority files. The content is curated by an [international group of editors](https://bartoc.org/contact) and it is published as open content in human-readable and machine-readable form. The migration includes a change of the name from "Basel Register of Thesauri, Ontologies & Classifications" to "Basic Register of Thesauri, Ontologies & Classifications". BARTOC was developed and hosted at [University Library Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/University-Society/University-Library-Basel-.html) by Andreas Ledl starting in 2013. Its new technical infrastructure is based on [project coli-conc](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/). With the relaunch BARTOC becomes a central element of authority based services such as uniform lookup in vocabularies and authority file mappings with the [web application Cocoda](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/).

The URL of BARTOC stays at <https://bartoc.org/> and we made sure to keep all existing links and content. Feedback, corrections and hints on additional vocabularies are welcome by the BARTOC editors!
