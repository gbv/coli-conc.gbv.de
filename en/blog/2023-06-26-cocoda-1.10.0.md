Release 1.10.0 of [Cocoda]({{ "/cocoda/" | url }}) introduces several small bug fixes and improvements, a new edition of [the user manual](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/app/user-manual-en.html) and two new features:

- Support of **non-indexing concepts**: these structural entities are used for grouping in some classifications but they should not be used for subject indexing or mapping. Cocoda now shows a special icon to differentiate these concepts and a warning if someone tries to map with them.

- Extension of the review workflow to support **justifications of negative evaluation** of a mapping. The following reasons, listed in the [Mapping Mismatch Vocabulary](https://bartoc.org/en/node/20429#content), can be given:

    - **redundant mapping**: The mapping is unnecessary as it has no applications or it can be derived from other mappings
    - **wrong mapping relation**: The mapping relation is missing or incorrect
    - **incompatible scope**: Scope of source and target concept are incompatible
