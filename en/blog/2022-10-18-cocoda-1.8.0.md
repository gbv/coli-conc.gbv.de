With release 1.8.0 of [Cocoda]({{ "/cocoda/" | url }}), the mapping tool now provides a filter by annotation within the mapping search.

We have also reimplemented mapping suggestions via catalog co-occurrences for a selected concept in the mapping navigator. This feature is based on a data dump of K10plus (more information [on Github](https://github.com/gbv/k10plus-subjects) and in this [blog post]({{ "/blog/2022/07/12/k10plus-inhaltserschliessung-als-open-data/" | url }})) and uses a new [occurrences-api](https://github.com/gbv/occurrences-api).

SkoHub vocabularies are now partially supported (see also [Added support of SkoHub vocabularies](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/blog/2022/06/23/cocoda-sdk-skohub/)); MyCoRe vocabs like [Sachgruppen der Schleswig-Holsteinischen Bibliographie](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/app/?fromScheme=http%3A%2F%2Fbartoc.org%2Fen%2Fnode%2F1992) are now fully supported.

The release also includes some additional changes. You can find the full release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/releases/tag/1.8.0).
