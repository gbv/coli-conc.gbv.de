With release 1.8.0 of [Cocoda](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/) the mapping tool now provides a filter by annotation within the mapping search. 

We implemented also a new suggestions-tab in the navigator in which concept co-occurences of a selected mapping are shown. This feature is based on a data dump of k10plus (more information [on Github](https://github.com/gbv/k10plus-subjects) and in this [Blogpost](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/blog/2022/07/12/k10plus-inhaltserschliessung-als-open-data/)) and uses a special [occurrences-api](https://github.com/gbv/occurrences-api).

SkoHub vocabularies are now partially supported (see also [Added support of SkoHub vocabularies
](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/blog/2022/06/23/cocoda-sdk-skohub/); MyCoRE vocabs like [Sachgruppen der Schleswig-Holsteinischen Bibliographie](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/app/?fromScheme=http%3A%2F%2Fbartoc.org%2Fen%2Fnode%2F1992) are fully supported. 

The release also includes some additional changes. You can find the full release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/releases/tag/1.8.0).
