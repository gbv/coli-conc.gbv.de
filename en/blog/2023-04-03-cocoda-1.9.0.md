Release 1.9.0 of [Cocoda]({{ "/cocoda/" | url }}) improves how concept data is displayed. All important information is now visible in the first tab as well as inside a popover in Mapping Search/Navigator.

The latter will make it easier to choose the right mapping suggestion without having to select the concept.

The [German user documentation](https://gbv.github.io/cocoda/dev/user-manual-de.html) was completely revised and should now match the English version.

This release also includes some additional changes, including important changes to Docker usage. You can find the full release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/releases/tag/1.9.0) for more information.
