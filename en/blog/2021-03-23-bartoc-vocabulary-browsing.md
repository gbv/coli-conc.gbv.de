The vocabulary registry [BARTOC](https://bartoc.org/) contains metadata about several thousand library classifications, thesauri, ontologies and other controlled vocabularies to improve visibility and findability of knowledge organization systems. With the migration to coli-conc infrastructure, we also aim to improve direct access to vocabulary content. This includes information about public APIs to access vocabularies, for instance [Skosmos](https://skosmos.org/), [Skohub](https://skohub.io/), [JSKOS API](https://github.com/gbv/jskos-server#jskos-server), SPARQL, and other kinds of webservices. 

Based on these APIs we started to implement searching and browsing in vocabularies as part of BARTOC user interface. See [Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms](http://bartoc.org/en/node/18538#content), [EuroVoc](http://bartoc.org/en/node/15#content), [Regensburger Verbundklassifikation (RVK)](https://bartoc.org/en/node/533#content), and [DDC](http://bartoc.org/en/node/241#content). The latter is only available in German because of the license. 

Unification of vocabulary services in BARTOC will be presented at poster at [Code4Lib 2021 conference](https://2021.code4lib.org/). A small slideset is available via <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4629367>.
