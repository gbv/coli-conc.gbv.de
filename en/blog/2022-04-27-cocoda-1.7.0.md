Release 1.7.0 of [Cocoda]({{ "/cocoda/" | url}}) adds support for creating and managing concordances as well as assigning mappings to a concordance. Previously, this could only be done manually in the backend. At the moment, creating new concordances is restricted to certain users. If you want to create your own concordances in our database or contribute to our concordances, please [contact us]({{ "/contact/" | url}}).

The release also includes some additional changes and bug fixes. You can find the full release notes [on GitHub](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/releases/tag/1.7.0).
