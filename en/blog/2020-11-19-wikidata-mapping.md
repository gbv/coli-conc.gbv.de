Last month the [WikiCite Virtual Conference](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite/2020_Virtual_conference) took place with 32 hours of presentations and discussion in 5 languages. Recordings are available, there is a lot of interesting input! In particular we co-organized a [session on Knowledge Organization and bibliographic data](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiCite/2020_Virtual_conference#Wissensorganisation_und_Bibliographische_Daten). After a keynote by Andrea Scharnhorst we gave a German introduction how to create and manage mappings between Wikidata and other vocabularies using [Cocoda]({{ "/cocoda/" | url }}). The presentation was later [repeated in English](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/File:Wikidata_Cocoda_Screencast.webm) as well (7 minutes).

In Wikidata there is also [a detailled documentation page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tools/Cocoda) about Cocoda. Have a look and [try out mapping](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/cocoda/wikidata/)!
