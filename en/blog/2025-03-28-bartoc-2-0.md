Since its migration to VZG in 2020/2021, we planned a rewrite and extension of the terminology registry [BARTOC](https://bartoc.org). Last year the [funding proposal](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7673393) was accepted for three years, so we started the development this month with a warm welcome to our new developer Rodolfo! Now we are looking for a (data) librarian to complete [our team](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/contact/).
