Data about Knowledge organization systems and their concordances can be available from many sources. We unify access to diverse data sources, including those with write-access, by mapping their data formats to [JSKOS format](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/). [Cocoda]({{ "/cocoda/" | url }}) organizes access to multiple data sources as **registries**. A registry is an individual source of data with known capabilities (see [Cocoda manual](https://gbv.github.io/cocoda/dev/user-manual-en.html#registries)).
