The goal of **coli-rich** is enrichment of subject indexing in library catalogs based on mappings between different vocabularies.

<!-- The application consists of two parts:
* A [web interface](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/coli-rich/app/) to test and experiment with enrichments
* A [web service](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/coli-rich/app/api) to query enrichments from
-->

Mainly targeted at PICA-based library databases, the coli-rich application is documented in German. More information can be found [at the German version of this page]({{ "/de/coli-rich/" | url }}) and in the [coli-rich git repository](https://github.com/gbv/coli-rich#readme).
