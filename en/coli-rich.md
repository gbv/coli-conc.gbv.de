**coli-rich** is an application to enrich subject indexing in library catalogs with mappings. The application consists of two parts:

* A [web interface](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/coli-rich/app/) to test and experiment with enrichments
* A [web service](https://coli-conc.gbv.de/coli-rich/app/api) to query enrichments from

Targeted at PICA-based library databases, the application is mainly documented in German. More information can be found [at the German version of this page]({{ "/de/coli-rich/" | url }}) and in the [coli-rich git repository](https://github.com/gbv/coli-rich#readme).
