An occurrence gives the number of times a selected concept is used in a given
database.  Co-occurrences give the number for combination of concepts so they
can be used as mapping recommendations.  We provide an [Occurrence
API](//coli-conc.gbv.de/occurrences/api/) to query GBV databases for
[(co-)occurrences in JSKOS](https://gbv.github.io/jskos/jskos.html#concept-occurrences).
