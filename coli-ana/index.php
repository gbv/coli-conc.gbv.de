**coli-ana** is a tool for analysis of synthesized DDC numbers. The tool is
being developed as part of project colibri, of which coli-conc is also a
sub-project. coli-conc plans to intergrate the results of  coli-ana into its
infrastructure and  provide information on decomposed DDC numbers in different
formats (MARC, JSKOS...). The results of this tool present a great value for
subject-indexers, mapping works and for the research community.
